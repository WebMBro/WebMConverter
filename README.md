WebMConverter
=============
WebM for retards. Basically, a wrapper around ffmpeg made for converting videos to WebM without having to use the command line.

Download it [here](https://github.com/WebMBro/WebMConverter/releases).
Download the latest Converter.zip.
Don't run ffmpeg.exe you retard, run WebMConverter.exe.
And I shouldn't have to tell you to extract the zip file first.
Also, don't click "Download ZIP" on the right side of the page, that'll only download the source. (unless you want to compile it yourself, obviously)

Important to know:
* Requires .NET Framework 4.5
* Already includes a copy of ffmpeg.exe
* Only works on Windows (I assume Linux users don't need GUIs)

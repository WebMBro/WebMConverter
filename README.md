WebMConverter
=============
WebM for***REMOVED***s. Basically, a wrapper around ffmpeg made for converting videos to WebM without having to use the command line.

Download it [here](https://github.com/WebMBro/WebMConverter/releases).
Download the latest Converter.zip.
Don't run ffmpeg.exe you***REMOVED***, run WebMConverter.exe.
And I shouldn't have to tell you to extract the zip file first.

Important to know:
* Requires .NET Framework 4.5
* Already includes a copy of ffmpeg.exe
* Only works on Windows (I assume Linux users don't need GUIs)
